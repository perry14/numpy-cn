# NumPy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

NumPy is licensed under the [BSD license](https://numpy.org/license.html#license), enabling reuse with few restrictions.

## Getting Started

To install NumPy, we strongly recommend using a *scientific Python* distribution. See [Installing the SciPy Stack](https://www.scipy.org/install.html) for details.

Many high quality online tutorials, courses, and books are available to get started with NumPy. For a quick introduction to NumPy we provide the [NumPy Tutorial](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html). We also recommend the [SciPy Lecture Notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/) for a broader introduction to the scientific Python ecosystem.

For more information on the SciPy Stack (for which NumPy provides the fundamental array data structure), see [scipy.org](https://www.scipy.org/).

## Documentation

The most up-to-date NumPy documentation can be found at [Latest (development) version](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs). It includes a user guide, full reference documentation, a developer guide, meta information, and “NumPy Enhancement Proposals” (which include the NumPy Roadmap and detailed plans for major new features).

A complete archive of documentation for all NumPy releases (minor versions; bug fix releases don’t contain significant documentation changes) since 2009 can be found at [https://docs.scipy.org](https://docs.scipy.org/).

## Support NumPy

If you have found NumPy to be useful in your work, research or company, please consider making a donation to the project commensurate with your resources. Any amount helps! All donations will be used strictly to fund the development of NumPy’s open source software, documentation and community.

Donations are managed by the NumFOCUS Foundation, which is the legal and fiscal umbrella for the project. NumFOCUS is a 501(c)3 non-profit foundation, so if you are subject to US Tax law, your contribution is tax-deductible. NumPy’s [Steering Council](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/dev/governance/index.html) will make the decisions on how to best use any funds received. Technical and infrastructure priorities are documented on the [NumPy Roadmap](https://www.numpy.org/neps/roadmap.html).

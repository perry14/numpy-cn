# Building from source

A general overview of building NumPy from source is given here, with detailed
instructions for specific platforms given separately.

## Prerequisites

Building NumPy requires the following software installed:

## Basic Installation

To install NumPy run:

``` python
pip install .
```

To perform an in-place build that can be run from the source folder run:

``` python
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

The NumPy build system uses ``setuptools`` (from numpy 1.11.0, before that it
was plain ``distutils``) and ``numpy.distutils``.
Using ``virtualenv`` should work as expected.

*Note: for build instructions to do development work on NumPy itself, see*
[Setting up and using your development environment](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_environment.html#development-environment).

## Testing

Make sure to test your builds. To ensure everything stays in shape, see if all tests pass:

``` python
$ python runtests.py -v -m full
```

For detailed info on testing, see [Testing builds](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_environment.html#testing-builds).

### Parallel builds

From NumPy 1.10.0 on itâ€™s also possible to do a parallel build with:

``` python
python setup.py build -j 4 install --prefix $HOME/.local
```

This will compile numpy on 4 CPUs and install it into the specified prefix.
to perform a parallel in-place build, run:

``` python
python setup.py build_ext --inplace -j 4
```

The number of build jobs can also be specified via the environment variable
``NPY_NUM_BUILD_JOBS``.

## FORTRAN ABI mismatch

The two most popular open source fortran compilers are g77 and gfortran.
Unfortunately, they are not ABI compatible, which means that concretely you
should avoid mixing libraries built with one with another. In particular, if
your blas/lapack/atlas is built with g77, you *must* use g77 when building
numpy and scipy; on the contrary, if your atlas is built with gfortran, you
*must* build numpy/scipy with gfortran. This applies for most other cases
where different FORTRAN compilers might have been used.

### Choosing the fortran compiler

To build with gfortran:

``` python
python setup.py build --fcompiler=gnu95
```

For more information see:

``` python
python setup.py build --help-fcompiler
```

### How to check the ABI of blas/lapack/atlas

One relatively simple and reliable way to check for the compiler used to build
a library is to use ldd on the library. If libg2c.so is a dependency, this
means that g77 has been used. If libgfortran.so is a dependency, gfortran
has been used. If both are dependencies, this means both have been used, which
is almost always a very bad idea.

## Accelerated BLAS/LAPACK libraries

NumPy searches for optimized linear algebra libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK.
There are specific orders for searching these libraries, as described below.

### BLAS

The default order for the libraries are:

1. MKL
1. BLIS
1. OpenBLAS
1. ATLAS
1. Accelerate (MacOS)
1. BLAS (NetLIB)

If you wish to build against OpenBLAS but you also have BLIS available one
may predefine the order of searching via the environment variable
``NPY_BLAS_ORDER`` which is a comma-separated list of the above names which
is used to determine what to search for, for instance:

``` python
NPY_BLAS_ORDER=ATLAS,blis,openblas,MKL python setup.py build
```

will prefer to use ATLAS, then BLIS, then OpenBLAS and as a last resort MKL.
If neither of these exists the build will fail (names are compared
lower case).

### LAPACK

The default order for the libraries are:

1. MKL
1. OpenBLAS
1. libFLAME
1. ATLAS
1. Accelerate (MacOS)
1. LAPACK (NetLIB)

If you wish to build against OpenBLAS but you also have MKL available one
may predefine the order of searching via the environment variable
``NPY_LAPACK_ORDER`` which is a comma-separated list of the above names,
for instance:

``` python
NPY_LAPACK_ORDER=ATLAS,openblas,MKL python setup.py build
```

will prefer to use ATLAS, then OpenBLAS and as a last resort MKL.
If neither of these exists the build will fail (names are compared
lower case).

### Disabling ATLAS and other accelerated libraries

Usage of ATLAS and other accelerated libraries in NumPy can be disabled
via:

``` python
NPY_BLAS_ORDER= NPY_LAPACK_ORDER= python setup.py build
```

or:

``` python
BLAS=None LAPACK=None ATLAS=None python setup.py build
```

## Supplying additional compiler flags

Additional compiler flags can be supplied by setting the ``OPT``,
``FOPT`` (for Fortran), and ``CC`` environment variables.
When providing options that should improve the performance of the code ensure
that you also set ``-DNDEBUG`` so that debugging code is not executed.

## Building with ATLAS support

### Ubuntu

You can install the necessary package for optimized ATLAS with this command:

``` python
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
```

# The NumPy community

The community of NumPy users and developers is large and decentralized. We
try to direct certain conversations to certain channels.

1. Use the [#numpy tag on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/numpy)
for  *usage*  questions (like “How do I do  *X*  in NumPy?”).
1. Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues) for
    1. **Bug reports** (like “``np.arange(3).shape`` returns ``(5,)``, when it should return ``(3,)``.”)
    1. **Documentation issues** (like “I found this section unclear”)
    1. **Feature requests** (like “I would like to have a new interpolation method in ``np.percentile``.”)
1. Use the [NumPy mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion)
for longer-form discussion items. This is for things that concern the
broader NumPy community.  Most users probably don’t care about an obscure
edge-case in ``np.polynomial.Legendre`` (which  should be reported on the
issue tracker), but may care about larger-picture things like
    1. How should we have discussions about NumPy and the community?
    1. Developing or adding items to a NumPy roadmap
    1. Announcing sprints or conference talks
    1. Changes to the development workflow
    1. Announcements for NumPy releases and developer meetings
    1. …
